# KGB
KGB - Kool GIMP Bundle, is my personal collection of GIMP enhancements, to make GIMP do what I wish with it. It may be a series of brushes, a collection of lua scripts or scheme scripts, or maybe even a bit of C. The possibilities are endless.

You'll find scheme stuff under scripts (should I make any) and python stuff under the plug-ins. Note: for python under GIMP 2.10 (Which uses python2 and NOT python3), GNU/Linux users have to GIMP from flatpak because most likely your distro dropped python2 support a long time ago. Windows users are fine because GIMP installer bundles python2 with it.

Everything is under the terms (as of right now, it started as an MIT licensed project) of the GNU General Public License version 3.0. See LICENSE or COPYING for more details.

I need to remember to always launch gimp from the terminal, possibly also include --verbose because then I get actual feedback on what went wrong. Otherwise it's a complete guess why the script isn't working, if it showed up at all.
