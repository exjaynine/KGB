# KGB
KGB - Kool GIMP Bundle, is my personal collection of GIMP scheme (script-fu) scripts to make GIMP do what I wish with it. In addition to scheme scripts, non scheme related stuff like new brushes is also a possibility, just not as high of a priority.

Scheme is built directly into GIMP without requiring any external tools, so making it easier to setup. I also intend to make a few scripts meant more for animators or comic book artists, so stay tuned.
