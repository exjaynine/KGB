# KGB
KGB - Kool GIMP Bundle, is my personal collection of GIMP enhancements, to make GIMP do what I wish with it. It may be a series of brushes, a collection of lua scripts or scheme scripts, or maybe even a bit of C. The possibilities are endless.

You'll find scheme stuff under scripts (should I make any) and python stuff under the plug-ins. Note: for python under GIMP 2.10 (Which uses python2 and NOT python3), GNU/Linux users have to GIMP from flatpak because most likely your distro dropped python2 support a long time ago. Windows users are fine because GIMP installer bundles python2 with it.

Just putting this under the MIT license, because I don't intend for the individual scripts to be big enough for it to be under GPL.
